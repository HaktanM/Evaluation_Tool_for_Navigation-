# Evaluation_Tool_for_Navigation-
An evaluation tool which can analyze multiple runs in terms of position, velocity and orientation errors. Additionally, the covariance is visualized with errors. 

vol6 includes a few additional utilities to project the errors on to NED (north-easth-down) frame. These utilities are only necessary when the navigation frame is chosen as Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) frame. It is easire to examine the performance of the odometry algorithm in NED frame compared to ECEF frame.  

You can directly dowlaod the code and run vol5. Make sure that the example dataset is also dowloaded.
