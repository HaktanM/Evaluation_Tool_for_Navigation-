# Evaluation_Tool_for_Navigation-
An evaluation tool which can analyze multiple runs in terms of position, velocity and orientation errors. Additionally, the covariance is visualized with errors. 

vol6 includes a few additional utilities to project the errors on to NED (north-easth-down) frame. These utilities are only necessary when the navigation frame is chosen as Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) frame. It is easire to examine the performance of the odometry algorithm in NED frame compared to ECEF frame.
